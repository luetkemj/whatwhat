What is this whole thing?

trying to get some sense of VIM and figure I would just try and ramble and write inside it. 

USA is playing against Belgium in the World Cup. We are 14:45 in. 

The folks in the booth just finished yakking about how the Belgiums were expecting some sort of battle that the US isn't giving.

I'm still working on this whole VIM thing. sytax highlighting doing some strange things. Realizing how much I need to learn to touch type.

DAMMIT! US got close on a corner. Not that close but close enopugh to make some noise...

GAH! Another close one. Gotta wrap and head out in a min...

Grabbing the young one and heading for a run with a rather wounded SO. screwed up on a recent application. Hopefully that can be remedied.

I run to slow me down.

I run because it's an easy to be awful 

I run because it's okay to be awful

I run because it brings me comfort

I run because it makes sense

I run run because there is no sense in it

I run because it's empty

and I run because it is full

I run for joy and peace and pain and love

Off topic ramble here but I've been going through a crazy heavy workload and spending a lot of time in this foggy area.

A big part of my job is doing things I don't know how to do (like new development techniques languages etc). Design by it's very nature involves a whole lot of exploration and dead ends. So I spend a lot of days in a very uncertain fog. Will I be able to figure out this new library in time? Am I going in the right direction with this design? What is my direction? Am I any good at this anyways? Why the fuck did I get hired for this? Commence complete and total mental break as I disintegrate into a bucket of uncertainty.

During all of this I have been running more and more. On really long runs I have one goal: get back home. Sometimes that can get hairy. I may be 3-4 miles out and completely out of energy. I don't carry a phone with me so I won't be getting a ride. Long story short I have to hoof it on my own two feet or spend the night in the forest.

This exercise of heading out on the trail and returning is a sort of practice for me when I am in the fog at work. I have to trust that I will find my way because there is no other viable alternative. I get tough and find my way back or starve. Be it on the trail or at work. If I do not succeed I will have a bad time.
