What is this whole thing?

trying to get some sense of VIM and figure I would just try and ramble and write inside it. 

USA is playing against Belgium in the World Cup. We are 14:45 in. 

The folks in the booth just finished yakking about how the Belgiums were expecting some sort of battle that the US isn't giving.

I'm still working on this whole VIM thing. sytax highlighting doing some strange things. Realizing how much I need to learn to touch type.

DAMMIT! US got close on a corner. Not that close but close enopugh to make some noise...

GAH! Another close one. Gotta wrap and head out in a min...

Grabbing the young one and heading for a run with a rather wounded SO. screwed up on a recent application. Hopefully that can be remedied.
